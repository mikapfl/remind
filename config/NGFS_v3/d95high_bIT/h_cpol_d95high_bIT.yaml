description: 'h_cpol_d95high_bIT: The Current Policies scenario assumes that only
  currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks. Emissions
  grow until 2080 leading to about 3 K of warming and severe physical risks. This
  includes irreversible changes like higher sea level rise. Industry sectors are modeled
  explicitly with individual CES nests for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production.
  The transport model EDGE-T with detailed modes/vehicles representation is used.
  A simple buildings model represents demand in terms of energy carriers. Damages
  from climate change are based on Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) using the 95th percentile
  of RCP26.'
