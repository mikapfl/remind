description: 'd_rap_d95high_bIT: The Divergent Net Zero scenario reaches net-zero
  by 2050 but with higher costs due to divergent policies introduced across sectors
  and a quicker phase out of fossil fuels. Climate policies are more stringent in
  the transportation and buildings sectors. This mimics a situation where the failure
  to coordinate policy stringency across sectors results in a high burden on consumers,
  while decarbonisation of energy supply and industry is less stringent. Emissions
  are in line with a climate goal giving at least a 50 percent chance of limiting
  global warming to below 1.5 K by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot
  of 1.5 K in earlier years. This leads to considerably high transition risks but
  rather low physical risks. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual
  CES nests for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production. The transport model
  EDGE-T with detailed modes/vehicles representation is used. A simple buildings model
  represents demand in terms of energy carriers. Damages from climate change based
  on Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) are internalized in the optimization using the 95th percentile
  of RCP26.'
