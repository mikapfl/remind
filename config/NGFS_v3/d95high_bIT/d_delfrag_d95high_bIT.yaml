description: 'd_delfrag_d95high_bIT: The Delayed Transition scenario assumes global
  annual emissions do not decrease until 2030. Strong policies are then needed to
  limit warming to below 2 K. The level of action differs across countries and regions
  based on currently implemented policies, leading to a fossil recovery out of the
  economic crisis brought about by COVID-19. The availability of CDR technologies
  is assumed to be low. Emissions exceed the carbon budget temporarily and decline
  more rapidly than in Well-below 2 K after 2030 to ensure a 67 percent chance of
  limiting global warming to below 2 K. This leads to considerable transition and
  physical risks. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual CES nests
  for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production. The transport model EDGE-T with
  detailed modes/vehicles representation is used. A simple buildings model represents
  demand in terms of energy carriers. Damages from climate change based on Kalkuhl
  and Wenz (2020) are internalized in the optimization using the 95th percentile of
  RCP26.'
