description: 'o_2c_bIT: The Below 2 Degrees C scenario assumes that climate policies
  are introduced immediately and become gradually more stringent, giving a 67 percent
  chance of limiting global warming to below 2 K. Deployment of CDR is relatively
  low. Net-zero CO2 emissions are achieved after 2070. Physical and transition risks
  are both relatively low. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual
  CES nests for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production. The transport model
  EDGE-T with detailed modes/vehicles representation is used. A simple buildings model
  represents demand in terms of energy carriers. No Damages from climate change are
  considered.'
