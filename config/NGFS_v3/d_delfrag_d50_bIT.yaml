description: 'd_delfrag_d50_bIT: The Delayed Transition scenario assumes global annual
  emissions do not decrease until 2030. Strong policies are then needed to limit warming
  to below 2 K. The level of action differs across countries and regions based on
  currently implemented policies, leading to a fossil recovery out of the economic
  crisis brought about by COVID-19. The availability of CDR technologies is assumed
  to be low. Emissions exceed the carbon budget temporarily and decline more rapidly
  than in Well-below 2 K after 2030 to ensure a 67 percent chance of limiting global
  warming to below 2 K. This leads to considerable transition and physical risks.
  Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual CES nests for cement, chemicals,
  steel, and other production. The transport model EDGE-T with detailed modes/vehicles
  representation is used. A simple buildings model represents demand in terms of energy
  carriers. Damages from climate change based on Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) are internalized
  in the optimization using the 50th percentile of RCP26.'
