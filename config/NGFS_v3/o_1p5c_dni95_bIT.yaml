description: 'o_1p5c_dni95_bIT: The Net Zero 2050 scenario assumes that ambitious
  climate policies are introduced immediately, giving at least a 50 percent chance
  of limiting global warming to below 1.5 K by the end of the century, with no or
  low overshoot of 1.5 K in earlier years. Stringent climate policies and innovation
  let net zero CO2 emissions to be reached around 2050. CDR is used to accelerate
  the decarbonisation but kept to the minimum possible and broadly in line with sustainable
  levels of bioenergy production. Physical risks are relatively low but transition
  risks are high. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual CES nests
  for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production. The transport model EDGE-T with
  detailed modes/vehicles representation is used. A simple buildings model represents
  demand in terms of energy carriers. Damages from climate change are based on Kalkuhl
  and Wenz (2020) using the 95th percentile of RCP26.'
